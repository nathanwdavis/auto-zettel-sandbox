## 2026-08-31 — Spike: prove the remote cycle end-to-end

- **status:** answered
- **answer:** The shared mechanism is a reinvestment feedback loop — each
  period's output is fed back into the base that produces the next period's
  output. See
  [[atomic-notes-and-compound-interest-share-a-reinvestment-loop--202608311038]],
  grounded in the existing fixture notes plus one new verified source
  (Housel, *The Psychology of Money*, ref 202608311036, verified live via
  Open Library and captured to raw/).
- **priority:** normal
- **asked_by:** human

This is a small verification run. Answer from the notes already in this
repository plus at most ONE new source: what is the shared mechanism between
atomic note-taking and compound interest? If you research the one new source,
capture it into raw/ first and verify it. Keep the cycle small and finish
cleanly — the point is to exercise the full path (lock, branch, gates, PR),
not to grow the wiki.

## 2026-08-31 — Follow-up: strengthen grounding of Housel literature note

- **status:** answered
- **answer:** Full chapter text was not obtainable (Open Library/archive.org
  list the ebook as "restricted" availability, so it could not be fetched
  directly). Captured a small set of verbatim ch. 4 quotations instead —
  cross-checked word-for-word across two independent secondary sources
  before use — into
  raw/202608311119-housel-ch4-confounding-compounding-excerpt.txt, linked
  from the reference note's new `excerpt_captures` field. Re-scored
  [[housel-on-compounding-as-time-in-the-loop--202608311037]] at
  groundedness 0.90 (was 0.72): both propositional claims (duration over
  rate; outsized/counterintuitive result) now have a direct corroborating
  quote. This is a strong excerpt, not a complete-text verification — that
  residual gap is recorded in the literature note itself rather than
  hidden, in case a future run gets real chapter access.
- **priority:** low
- **asked_by:** maintenance-run (critic finding, 2026-08-31 cycle)

literature/housel-on-compounding-as-time-in-the-loop--202608311037 scored
groundedness 0.72 (FLAG): its raw capture is Open Library bibliographic
metadata only, which corroborates the locator (ch. 4, "Confounding
Compounding") but not the summary's propositional content. Capture actual
chapter text into raw/ and re-score before building further on this note.

## 2026-08-31 — Follow-up: literature/ahrens-on-the-slip-box-workflow only covers the Introduction and opening of Chapter 1

- **status:** new
- **priority:** low
- **asked_by:** maintenance-run (2026-08-31 cycle, gap-fill against topic 'zettelkasten method')

This cycle replaced the note's content-free placeholder ("Own-words summary
of [[ref]].") with a real summary grounded in verbatim quotes captured from
the official author-published preview PDF of *How to Take Smart Notes*
(takesmartnotes.com) — see
raw/202608311141-ahrens-ch1-everything-you-need-to-know-excerpt.txt and
[[ahrens-on-the-slip-box-workflow--202608301100]]. The preview only reaches
the Introduction and the opening of Chapter 1 ("Everything You Need to
Know"), which covers *why* a trusted structure beats a plan, not yet the
fleeting-note/literature-note/permanent-note taxonomy itself — that content
is in Chapter 6 ("Simplicity Is Paramount", pp. 36-44) and Chapters 9-11
("Separate and Interlocking Tasks" / "Read for Understanding" / "Take Smart
Notes", pp. 55-104). A future run should capture that range (a library copy,
a different legitimate preview, or purchased access) and either extend this
literature note or write a second one, then ground the existing
atomicity/titles permanent notes
([[one-idea-per-note-enables-reuse--202701010002]],
[[titles-stated-as-claims-force-clarity--202701010003]]) to it if their
claims do turn out to be directly attributable to Ahrens rather than
independent synthesis.
